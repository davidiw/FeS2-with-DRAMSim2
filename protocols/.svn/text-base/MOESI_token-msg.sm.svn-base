/* This file is part of SLICC (Specification Language for Implementing
   Cache Coherence), a component of the Multifacet GEMS (General
   Execution-driven Multiprocessor Simulator) software toolset
   originally developed at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

   SLICC was originally developed by Milo Martin with substantial
   contributions from Daniel Sorin.

   Ruby was originally developed primarily by Milo Martin and Daniel
   Sorin with contributions from Ross Dickson, Carl Mauer, and Manoj
   Plakal.

   Substantial further development of Multifacet GEMS at the
   University of Wisconsin was performed by Alaa Alameldeen, Brad
   Beckmann, Ross Dickson, Pacia Harper, Milo Martin, Michael Marty,
   Carl Mauer, Kevin Moore, Manoj Plakal, Daniel Sorin, Min Xu, and
   Luke Yen.

   Additional development was performed at the University of
   Pennsylvania by Milo Martin.
