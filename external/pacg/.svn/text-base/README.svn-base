To use these libraries, add this directory to your PYTHONPATH environment
variable, and put "from pacg import *" at the top of your python script.
You can then access e.g. the appendToFile function in shell.py via
"shell.appendToFile".

To view the documentation of these libraries, run pydoc -g, and either browse
the documentation or search for a specific function.
